This is a new file I added on Tori's project.

Steps:

1. create private a fork on Tori's project.
2. pull private fork to my Mac
    'git clone https://github.com/johnmuth81/vision.git'

3. Create new file locally.
   vi newfile
   git add newfile
   git commit -a

== Test an update ==
This line is an update. I cloned straight from Tori's master on this 
one.
